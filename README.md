## üöß Known Challenges & Solutions

* **Dynamic Updating**
  ‚Ä¢ Snippet list refreshes live when adding or editing‚Äîimplemented via EF Core change tracking.
* **Null Field Errors**
  ‚Ä¢ Validations prevent empty titles or code bodies.
* **Syntax Highlighting**
  ‚Ä¢ AvalonEdit may lag with very large files‚Äîoptimized by limiting font rendering on huge text blocks.
